***TODO:FIXME:***
1. There is a bug when you do the auto calibration.
Picking up the countour with the biggest area after calling findCountour is not proper. Need to find a better way to achieve this.
2. For the near range model, the calibration method is wrong, NOT reliable at all!. Need to find a better way to achieve this.
